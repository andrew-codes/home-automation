 
## this where the mappings are made to each server and port. Everytime you place a new wsebserver, you need to update this file:
## mapping of servers to upstream servers ###
## In this section, we have to pair frontend and backend servers
#  everytime we want have them reverse proxied
## e.g. <realserver.domainname>:port   <backendservervariable>

 map $ssl_preread_server_name:$server_port $upstream {
    ha.smith-simms.family:443 ha;
    grafana.smith-simms.family:443 grafana;
    status.smith-simms.family:443 uptime_kuma;
}
