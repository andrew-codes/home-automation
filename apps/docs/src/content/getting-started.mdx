| DEV        | This is the machine you will use to deploy the home automation repo. It will provision resources in a local Proxmox environment; including a Kubernetes cluster. |
| HYPERVISOR | Machine running **Proxmox** used to host `LXC` containers.                                                                                                       |
| LXC        | Container running directly on Proxmox. You can think of these as light-weight virtual machines.                                                                  |
| K8S        | Kubernetes cluster; running as an `LXC` container on the `HYPERVISOR`.                                                                                           |
| CONTAINER  | Containers running in the `K8S` cluster.                                                                                                                         |
| NFS        | A network file share using the NFS protocol; preferably setup on a NAS.                                                                                          |
| PROVISION  | The process of creating an `LXC` on the `HYPERVISOR`.                                                                                                            |
| DEPLOY     | The process of ensuring an application is running on a provisioned machine and/or hosted in `K8S`.                                                               |
