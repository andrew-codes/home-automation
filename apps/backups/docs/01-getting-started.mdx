# Prepare Secrets

## backup/config

The primary secret controlling the deployment process is `backup/config`. This string value is a JSON array of objects. Each object represents a single user on a single family computer. The array can contain multiple objects, allowing for the configuration of multiple users across multiple family computers.

Each object contains the following fields:

- `username`: The username of the user on the family computer.
- `ip`: The IP address of the family computer.
- `os`: The operating system of the family computer. Supported values are either `windows` or `macos`.
- `password`: (optional) The password for the user on the family computer. This is only required if `os=windows`.
- `profileName`: (optional) This is the user's profile name on the family machine; if different from the username.

Here is a complete example of a `backup/config` secret for two family computers; one with one user and one with two users.

```json
[
  {
    "username": "john",
    "ip": "192.168.1.124",
    "os": "windows",
    "password": "password123"
  },
  {
    "username": "jane",
    "ip": "192.168.1.124",
    "os": "windows",
    "password": "password123"
  },
  {
    "username": "john",
    "ip": "192.168.1.245",
    "os": "macos",
    "profileName": "john-doe"
  }
]
```

## Other Required Secrets

Additionally, there are three other secrets that need to be populated.

> Note that 1Password may not persist the new line characters. If running into issues, try manually inserting `\n` into the secret text where a new line is required and remove the new line characters from the secret text.

- `backup/nas/ssh-key/private`: This is the private SSH key used to connect to the NAS. It should be capable of connecting to the NAS without a password.
- `backup/nas/ssh-key/public`: This is the public SSH key used to connect to the NAS. It should be capable of connecting to the NAS without a password.
- `backup/ssh-key/private`: This is the private SSH key used to connect to the family computer. It should be capable of connecting to the family computer without a password.
- `backup/ssh-key/public`: This is the public SSH key used to connect to the family computer. It should be capable of connecting to the family computer without a password.

# Run init command

The `init` command will ensure the above secrets are set up correctly. It will also create the necessary SSH keys and copy them to the appropriate locations.

```bash
yarn nx run backups:init
```

# Prepare NAS

The NAS (Network Attached Storage) device must be prepared to accept SSH connections from the family computers. This is accomplished by adding the public SSH key to the NAS's authorized keys.

> Note these commands are run from the root of the monorepo.

> **Note**: Replace `$nas_user` with the username for the NAS and `$nas_ip` with the IP address of the NAS.

1. **Enable SSH opn the NAS**: Ensure that SSH is enabled on the NAS device. This may vary depending on the NAS model and operating system. Refer to the NAS documentation for instructions on how to enable SSH.
1. **Ensure SSH key can access NAS**: Ensure that the SSH key can access the NAS device. This may vary depending on the NAS model and operating system. Refer to the NAS documentation for instructions on how to configure SSH access.
1. **Copy the public SSH key to the NAS**: Use the following command to copy the public SSH key to the NAS device:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ./apps/backups/.secrets/nas_rsa.pub $nas_user@$nas_ip
   ```

1. **Test the connection**: Test the SSH connection from the family computer to the NAS using the private SSH key:

   ```bash
   ssh -i ./apps/backups/.secrets/nas_rsa $nas_user@$nas_ip
   ```

   If the connection is successful, you should be able to log in without being prompted for a password.

1. **Configure rsync**: Ensure that rsync is installed and configured on the NAS. This may vary depending on the NAS model and operating system. Refer to the NAS documentation for instructions on how to install and configure rsync.
1. **Create the backup directory**: Create a directory on the NAS where the backups will be stored. **The backup directory should be located on the NAS in the following location**: `nas_user@nas_ip:/volume1/backup/`.
1. **Set permissions**: Ensure that the backup directory has the correct permissions to allow the family computers to write to it. This may be done in the NAS web interface.
1. **Test the rsync command**: Test the rsync command from the family computer to the NAS to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done using the following command:

   ```bash
   rsync -avz -e "ssh -i ./apps/backups/.secrets/nas_rsa" /local/path $nas_user@$nas_ip:/volume1/backup/test
   ```

   Replace `/local/path` with the path to the local directory you want to back up. If the rsync command is successful, it should copy the files from the local directory to the backup directory on the NAS.

1. **Remove the test directory**: After testing the rsync command, remove the test directory from the NAS to free up space.

   ```bash
   ssh -i ./apps/backups/.secrets/nas_rsa $nas_user@$nas_ip "rm -rf /volume1/backup/test"
   ```

# Prepare Windows Machines

If the family computer is running Windows, the following steps are required to prepare it for the backup process:

1. **Enable WinRM**: See this guide for instructions on how to enable WinRM on Windows: [Enable WinRM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winrm/winrm-quickconfig).
2. **Configure WinRM**: See this guide for instructions on how to configure WinRM to be used with Ansible: [Configure WinRM](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_winrm.html#winrm-setup).

# Prepare MacOS Machines

> **Note**: Replace `$username` with the username for the MacOS computer and `$ip` with the IP address of the MacOS computer.

If the family computer is running MacOS, the following steps are required to prepare it for the backup process:

1. **Enable access via SSH**: See this guide for instructions on how to enable SSH on MacOS: [Enable SSH](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-a-remote-computer-to-access-your-mac-mchlp1066/mac).
1. **Copy SSH public keys**: Use the following command to copy the public SSH key to the family computer:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ./apps/backups/.secrets/ssh-key.pub $username@$ip
   ```

# Deployment

Once the secrets are configured and the family computers are prepared, the backup process can be deployed using Ansible. The deployment process will automatically configure the family computers to run the backup process hourly.

```bash
yarn nx run backups:deploy
```

## MacOS

These steps must be performed after deployment on MacOS machines.

1. **Full Disk Access**: Ensure the following applications have full disk access on the family computer:

   - `~/Applications/Backup.app`

   This is required for the backup process to run correctly. To grant full disk access, follow these steps:

   1. Open System Preferences.
   2. Click on Security & Privacy.
   3. Click on the Privacy tab.
   4. Select Full Disk Access from the list on the left.
   5. Click the lock icon in the bottom left corner to make changes.
   6. Enter your password when prompted.
   7. Click the add (plus icon) button to bring up Finder.
   8. Navigate to the application or use `CMD + SHIFT + G` and type applications's path
   9. Grant access.

1. Run the Backup app manually once. This ensures permissions are set correctly and the app is allowed to run in the background. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Open Finder.
   2. Navigate to `~/Applications`.
   3. Open the Backup app.
   4. Follow any prompts to allow the app to run.

# Verification

After the deployment process is complete, it is important to verify that the backup process is working correctly. This can be done by checking the following:

- **Scheduled Tasks**: Verify that the scheduled tasks or launchd jobs have been created on the family computers.

  - For Windows, check the Task Scheduler and manually run the task to Ensure it runs correctly.
  - For MacOS, check the launchd jobs using the following command:

    ```bash
    launchctl start com.user.backup
    ```

- **Backup Files**: Verify that the backup files are being created on the NAS and that they contain the expected data.
- **Logs**: Check the logs for any errors or warnings that may indicate a problem with the backup process. The logs can be found in the following locations:
  - For MacOS: `~/Applications/Backup.app/Contents/Resources/logs/*.log`
- **Incremental backups**: Verify that the incremental backups are being created correctly.

## Backup Failures

On MacOS, if the backup fails, then you will receive a notification in the notification center. You will only receive a notification if the backup fails, so ensure the notification is allowed. Click the notification will open the error logs. This can be used to troubleshoot the failure.
