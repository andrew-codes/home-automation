# My Home Automation

This mono-repo consists of several applications and services I use to create my home automation.

My home automation and, all related services, run in a local kubernetes cluster. I have automated the provisioning of the cluster, so tearing down or spinning one back up is fairly straight forward. See the [kubernetes cluster setup page](./docs/kubernetes-cluster-setup.md) for more information.
