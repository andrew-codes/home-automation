# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs are published to our architecture knowledge base:

Please use this link to browse them.

To preview the knowledge base locally, run:

yarn nx run docs-adr:start
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```bash
yarn adr new
```
