This document provides an overview of the backup process and its components. The backup process is designed to run hourly on family computers, ensuring that user data is securely backed up to a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device. This is accomplished through the use of rsync, which is a fast and versatile file copying tool that can synchronize files and directories between two locations over a network.

# Windows Machines

On Windows, the backup process is initiated using a scheduled task that runs a bat script. This script in turn runs a bash script via WSL. The bash script is responsible for executing the rsync command to perform the backup. The script is designed to be run as a scheduled task, which allows it to run automatically at specified intervals without user intervention.

> Note the rsync command is not natively available on Windows, so the backup process relies on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to provide a Linux-like environment where rsync can be executed. This allows for seamless integration of the backup process into the Windows operating system while leveraging the power of rsync for efficient file synchronization.

This script is responsible for executing the rsync command to perform the backup. The script is designed to be run as a scheduled task, which allows it to run automatically at specified intervals without user intervention.

# MacOS Machines

On MacOS, the backup process is initiated using a launchd job. This job runs a bash script that executes the rsync command to perform the backup. The script is designed to be run as a launchd job, which allows it to run automatically at specified intervals without user intervention.

# Deployment

Scripts and their configuration are deployed to the family computers using Ansible.
