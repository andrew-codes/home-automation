## Notes on What's Next

- [ ] tunnel services do not work with piholes enabled
- [ ] move deployment and provision scripts back out of src. These should not impact the caching of compile, package, and publish.
- [ ] nfs pvc creation does not require an IP, remove from libsonnet function API
- [ ] nfs pvc creation name excludes pvc suffix
- [ ] automate pihole conditional forwarding
- [ ] enable onepassword connect to be favored over CLI
- [x] k8s cluster should not delete `/run/flannel/subnet.env` on restart of container
- [x] cloudflared should not error and be able to resolve requests.
- [x] cloudflared should automatically add dns entries to cloudflare dns
- [x] cloudflared should create tunnel if no tunnel id exists.
- [x] observability app
- [x] configure grafana username and password when deploying
- [x] configure grafana proxmox dashboard auto generation on deployment
